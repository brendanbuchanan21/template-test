<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Evidence-based treatment including behavioral parent training and family therapy for ODD</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is characterized by a persistent pattern of angry, irritable mood, argumentative and defiant behavior, and vindictiveness toward authority figures. While all children and teens can be defiant at times, ODD involves more frequent and severe oppositional behaviors that cause significant problems at home, school, and in relationships. Children and adolescents with ODD may frequently lose their temper, argue with adults, refuse to comply with rules, deliberately annoy others, blame others for their mistakes, and show spite or vindictiveness. These behaviors create significant family conflict and distress.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide evidence-based ODD treatment that includes behavioral parent training, family therapy, and individual therapy for adolescents. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/behavior.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">CDC's information on children's behavior disorders</a>, ODD responds well to behavioral interventions and parent training. Our ODD therapy helps parents develop effective behavior management strategies while helping teens build emotional regulation and social skills. Many families also benefit from our <a href="/services/adolescent-mental-health" className="text-blue-600 underline">adolescent mental health services</a> for comprehensive support.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Our Approach to ODD Treatment</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Behavioral Parent Training</strong> Parent training is the cornerstone of effective ODD treatment. Parents learn positive reinforcement strategies, consistent consequences, effective communication, and how to set clear expectations. These skills significantly reduce oppositional behaviors and improve family relationships.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Individual Therapy for Teens</strong> Adolescents learn anger management, emotional regulation, problem-solving skills, and social skills. Therapy helps teens understand their emotions, develop healthier ways to express frustration, and improve relationships.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Family Therapy</strong> Family therapy addresses communication patterns, conflict resolution, and family dynamics that may contribute to oppositional behaviors. We help families develop healthier interaction patterns and rebuild positive relationships.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Improve Family Relationships</h3>
