<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Specialized therapy for personality disorders including BPD, using DBT and evidence-based approaches</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Personality disorders create long-standing patterns that affect relationships, emotions, self-image, and daily functioning. These patterns often develop early in life and can make it difficult to maintain stable relationships, regulate emotions, or feel a consistent sense of self. Effective personality disorder therapy helps you understand these patterns, develop healthier ways of relating to yourself and others, and build the life you want despite the challenges.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, our Certified Personality Disorder Treatment Provider offers specialized therapy for personality disorders using evidence-based approaches including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). According to the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, personality disorders are treatable conditions, and specialized treatment can significantly improve quality of life. Our comprehensive personality disorder treatment addresses not just symptoms but helps you develop sustainable skills for managing emotions and building meaningful relationships.</p>
