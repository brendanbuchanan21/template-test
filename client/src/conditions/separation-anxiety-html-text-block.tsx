<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Evidence-based treatment for separation anxiety in children, teens, and adults</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Separation Anxiety Disorder involves excessive fear or anxiety about separation from attachment figures—typically parents, romantic partners, or caregivers. While separation anxiety is normal in young children, Separation Anxiety Disorder causes distress that's inappropriate for developmental level and significantly interferes with daily functioning. Children may refuse to go to school, experience nightmares about separation, or develop physical symptoms when apart from parents. Adults with separation anxiety may experience excessive worry about loved ones' safety, difficulty being alone, or panic when separated from partners. This anxiety goes beyond normal concern and creates significant impairment.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide evidence-based separation anxiety treatment for children, adolescents, and adults. According to the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, separation anxiety disorder responds well to cognitive behavioral therapy and gradual exposure. Our separation anxiety therapy helps you or your child manage fear, build confidence in handling separation, and develop healthy independence. Many clients also benefit from our general <a href="/conditions/anxiety" className="text-blue-600 underline">anxiety therapy</a> for comprehensive anxiety treatment.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Our Approach to Separation Anxiety Treatment</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</strong> CBT helps challenge catastrophic thoughts about separation, develop realistic appraisals of danger, and build confidence in handling separation. You'll learn that feared outcomes rarely occur and that you can cope with temporary separation.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Gradual Exposure</strong> Exposure therapy involves gradually practicing separations in a structured, supportive way. Starting with brief separations and building to longer ones, you'll learn that anxiety naturally decreases and that you can handle being apart from attachment figures.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Parent Training (for Children)</strong> Parents learn strategies for supporting children through separation anxiety, avoiding accommodation of anxiety, and reinforcing brave behavior. Parent involvement is crucial for successful treatment of childhood separation anxiety.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Build Healthy Independence</h3>
