<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Trauma-informed treatment for survivors of childhood sexual abuse, sexual assault, and sexual trauma</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Sexual abuse and sexual assault are profound violations that affect every aspect of your being—your sense of safety, your relationship with your body, your ability to trust, and your core sense of self. Whether you experienced childhood sexual abuse, adult sexual assault, intimate partner sexual violence, or other forms of sexual trauma, the impact extends far beyond the event itself. You may struggle with PTSD symptoms, shame, difficulty with intimacy, hypervigilance, or feeling disconnected from your body. These responses are normal reactions to abnormal experiences—and healing is possible.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, our certified trauma specialists provide compassionate, evidence-based sexual abuse therapy in a safe, non-judgmental environment. We understand the unique complexities of sexual trauma and use specialized techniques including EMDR, Brainspotting, and Trauma-Focused CBT to support your healing. According to <a href="https://www.rainn.org/effects-sexual-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network)</a>, sexual violence creates lasting psychological effects, but trauma-informed therapy significantly supports recovery. Our sexual trauma treatment helps you process traumatic memories, reclaim your sense of safety, and rebuild your life. Many survivors also benefit from our <a href="/conditions/ptsd" className="text-blue-600 underline">PTSD treatment</a> for post-traumatic stress symptoms related to sexual trauma.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Our Approach to Sexual Abuse Therapy</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Trauma-Informed, Survivor-Centered Care</strong> Our sexual trauma therapy is grounded in trauma-informed principles that prioritize your safety, choice, and empowerment. You're in control of your healing process—we never push you to discuss details you're not ready to share. We create a safe therapeutic relationship built on trust, respect, and unconditional positive regard.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>EMDR for Sexual Trauma</strong> Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is highly effective for processing traumatic sexual experiences. EMDR helps your brain reprocess traumatic memories, reducing their emotional intensity and allowing you to develop more adaptive beliefs about yourself, what happened, and your safety. Many survivors experience significant relief from PTSD symptoms, flashbacks, and intrusive memories.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Brainspotting</strong> Brainspotting accesses trauma stored deep in the subcortical brain and body, where sexual trauma often resides. This technique is particularly effective for processing trauma held in the body, helping release physical and emotional pain related to sexual abuse.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Somatic Therapy and Body Work</strong> Sexual trauma is stored in the body, not just the mind. Somatic approaches help you safely reconnect with your body, release trauma held in the nervous system, and reclaim your physical self. You'll learn that your body is yours and deserves to be treated with care and respect.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">What to Expect in Therapy</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Sexual abuse therapy begins with establishing safety and building trust. We move at your pace, ensuring you feel safe and supported throughout treatment. You'll learn grounding techniques, coping skills, and strategies for managing triggers before processing traumatic memories.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">As therapy progresses, you'll process traumatic experiences using evidence-based techniques. You'll challenge beliefs of shame, self-blame, or worthlessness that developed following abuse. You'll learn that what happened wasn't your fault, that you deserved better, and that you can reclaim your life and body.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">We also address relationship patterns, intimacy concerns, and sexuality as appropriate. Therapy helps you develop healthy boundaries, rebuild trust in yourself and others, and explore what healthy relationships look like. The goal is comprehensive healing—not just managing symptoms but truly reclaiming your life.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">You Deserve Healing and Support</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Sexual abuse and assault weren't your fault, and you don't have to carry shame or pain forever. With specialized sexual abuse therapy, you can process trauma, reclaim your body and sexuality, heal relationship patterns, and build a fulfilling life.
