<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Specialized treatment for BDD, appearance preoccupation, and body image distress</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a serious mental health condition characterized by obsessive preoccupation with perceived flaws in your appearance that others don't notice or consider minor. If you spend hours each day thinking about appearance concerns, checking mirrors, seeking reassurance, or avoiding social situations due to perceived defects, you may be experiencing BDD. This condition causes significant distress and impairment, often leading to depression, social isolation, and in severe cases, suicide risk. BDD is not vanity or superficiality—it's a treatable mental health disorder.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide evidence-based body dysmorphic disorder treatment that addresses obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and distorted perceptions. According to the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, BDD is related to OCD and responds well to specialized therapy. Our BDD therapy uses cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure techniques to help you challenge appearance-related beliefs and reduce compulsive behaviors. Many clients also benefit from our <a href="/conditions/anxiety" className="text-blue-600 underline">anxiety therapy</a> when BDD creates significant social anxiety.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Our Approach to BDD Treatment</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for BDD</strong> CBT is the gold-standard treatment for body dysmorphic disorder. You'll learn to identify and challenge distorted thoughts about your appearance, understand cognitive biases that maintain BDD, and develop more balanced perceptions.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Exposure and Response Prevention</strong> ERP helps you gradually reduce compulsive behaviors like mirror checking, reassurance-seeking, and avoidance. You'll learn that anxiety naturally decreases without these behaviors and that your feared outcomes don't occur.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Perceptual Retraining</strong> BDD involves distorted visual processing. We help you learn to see yourself more accurately, reduce selective attention to perceived flaws, and develop a more balanced view of your overall appearance.</p>
