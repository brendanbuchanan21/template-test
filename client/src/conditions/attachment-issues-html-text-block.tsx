<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Evidence-based treatment for insecure attachment, trust issues, and relationship patterns rooted in childhood</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Attachment issues develop when early relationships with caregivers were inconsistent, neglectful, or traumatic, shaping how you relate to others throughout life. If you struggle with trust, fear abandonment, push people away when they get close, or find yourself repeating painful relationship patterns, these may be attachment wounds from childhood. Attachment styles—secure, anxious, avoidant, or disorganized—influence your expectations in relationships, how you handle conflict, your ability to be vulnerable, and whether you feel worthy of love. The good news is that attachment patterns aren't fixed—with therapy, you can develop earned secure attachment.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide attachment-focused therapy that helps you understand how early experiences shaped your relationship patterns, process childhood wounds, and develop healthier ways of relating. According to research published by the <a href="https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2018/06/attachment-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">American Psychological Association</a>, attachment patterns significantly impact adult relationships, but therapy can help develop earned secure attachment. Our evidence-based attachment therapy uses trauma processing, relational techniques, and skill-building to help you heal attachment wounds and build secure, fulfilling relationships. Many clients also benefit from our <a href="/conditions/childhood-trauma" className="text-blue-600 underline">childhood trauma therapy</a> for processing early attachment disruptions.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Understanding Your Attachment Style</strong> We help you identify your attachment patterns, understand their origins in childhood experiences, and recognize how they manifest in current relationships. Awareness is the first step toward change.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Processing Attachment Wounds</strong> Using EMDR and trauma-focused techniques, we process painful childhood experiences that created insecure attachment. Healing these early wounds allows you to develop new relationship templates.</p>

This experience helps you internalize new relationship templates.</p>
