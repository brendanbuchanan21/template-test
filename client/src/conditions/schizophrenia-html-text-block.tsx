<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Comprehensive support alongside medication management for improved functioning and quality of life</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Schizophrenia and psychotic disorders are serious mental health conditions characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, and behavior. Symptoms include hallucinations (hearing voices or seeing things others don't), delusions (fixed false beliefs), disorganized thinking and speech, reduced emotional expression, and decreased motivation and functioning. While schizophrenia requires medication management as a foundation of treatment, psychotherapy plays a crucial supportive role in managing symptoms, improving functioning, preventing relapse, and enhancing quality of life. Recovery is possible, and many people with schizophrenia lead fulfilling lives with appropriate treatment and support.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide supportive therapy for individuals living with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders as part of comprehensive treatment alongside psychiatric medication management. According to the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, combining medication with psychotherapy improves outcomes for schizophrenia. Our schizophrenia support therapy provides psychoeducation, coping strategies, relapse prevention, and functional support. Please note: We do not prescribe medication but can coordinate with your prescriber. Many clients also benefit from our <a href="/conditions/anxiety" className="text-blue-600 underline">anxiety therapy</a> when anxiety accompanies psychotic symptoms.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Our Approach to Supportive Therapy</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Psychoeducation</strong> Understanding your condition empowers you to manage it effectively. We provide education about schizophrenia, medication effects and side effects, symptom recognition, triggers, and early warning signs of relapse. Knowledge reduces fear and supports informed treatment decisions.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis</strong> CBT adapted for psychosis helps you evaluate beliefs about symptoms, reduce distress from hallucinations and delusions, and develop coping strategies. While CBT doesn't eliminate symptoms, it can reduce their impact on functioning and quality of life.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Coping Skills and Symptom Management</strong> You'll learn practical strategies for managing persistent symptoms including reality testing, distraction techniques, engaging in activities, and recognizing when to seek additional support. Coping skills increase sense of control.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Medication Adherence Support</strong> We support medication adherence by addressing concerns about side effects, discussing benefits, problem-solving barriers, and coordinating with your prescriber. Consistent medication use is crucial for symptom management and relapse prevention.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Functional Support</strong> Therapy helps improve daily functioning including self-care, social skills, work or school functioning, and independent living skills. We focus on goals that matter to you and support gradual progress toward increased independence.</p>
