<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Overcome intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors through specialized OCD treatment</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) traps you in exhausting cycles of intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed to reduce anxiety. Whether you're spending hours checking, cleaning, counting, or seeking reassurance, OCD can consume your life and create significant distress. The good news is that OCD therapy using Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is highly effective, and recovery is possible.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">ERP is the gold-standard treatment for OCD and the most effective therapy for obsessions and compulsions. This specialized OCD treatment involves gradually exposing yourself to feared situations, objects, or thoughts while resisting the urge to perform compulsions. While this sounds difficult, it's done gradually and systematically with expert guidance.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>How ERP Works</strong></p>
<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">During OCD therapy, you'll create a hierarchy of feared situations from least to most anxiety-provoking. Starting with easier exposures, you'll gradually face fears while practicing response prevention—resisting the compulsion to check, clean, seek reassurance, or perform other rituals. Over time, you'll learn that anxiety naturally decreases without compulsions, and that your feared outcomes don't actually happen.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Cognitive Therapy for OCD</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Our therapy for OCD also includes cognitive interventions that help you understand and challenge OCD-related beliefs. You'll learn about thought-action fusion (believing that thinking something makes it more likely to happen), inflated responsibility, and intolerance of uncertainty. Challenging these beliefs reduces the power that obsessive thoughts hold over you.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Many people with OCD also experience <a href="/conditions/anxiety" className="text-blue-600 underline">anxiety</a> disorders or depression alongside their OCD. Our comprehensive OCD treatment addresses these co-occurring conditions for complete recovery.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">What to Expect in OCD Counseling</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Effective OCD treatment requires commitment and active participation. You'll work on exposure exercises between sessions, practicing facing fears and resisting compulsions. While this can be challenging, our structured, supportive approach makes it manageable. Most people experience significant symptom reduction within 12-20 sessions of intensive ERP therapy.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Our OCD counseling also addresses the shame many people feel about their obsessions and compulsions. You'll learn that having intrusive thoughts doesn't mean anything about who you are as a person, and that OCD is a treatable medical condition, not a character flaw.</p>
