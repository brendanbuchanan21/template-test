<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Specialized brainspotting treatment for complex PTSD, dissociation, and deep-seated trauma</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Brainspotting is an advanced brain-based therapy that accesses and processes trauma stored deep in the subcortical brain—the parts of your brain that hold emotional memories beyond conscious awareness. Developed by Dr. David Grand, brainspotting therapy uses your visual field to locate eye positions (brainspots) that correlate with traumatic experiences stored in your brain. By holding your gaze on these specific eye positions, brainspotting allows your brain to access, process, and release deeply held trauma. Brainspotting is particularly effective for complex trauma, dissociation, and cases where traditional talk therapy or even EMDR hasn't fully resolved symptoms.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide specialized brainspotting therapy for clients dealing with complex PTSD, dissociative disorders, and deep-seated trauma that hasn't responded to other treatments. Our approach is gentle, client-centered, and highly effective for reaching trauma that other modalities can't access. According to research published by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007095/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>, brainspotting shows promising results for trauma treatment and emotional regulation. Many clients combine brainspotting with our <a href="/treatments/emdr" className="text-blue-600 underline">EMDR therapy</a> for comprehensive trauma healing.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">How Brainspotting Works</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Finding Your Brainspot</strong> During a brainspotting session, you'll focus on a disturbing issue while the therapist guides your eyes to locate the specific eye position (brainspot) where you feel the strongest activation. This eye position corresponds to the area in your brain where the trauma is stored.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Processing Through the Brainspot</strong> While you hold your gaze on the brainspot, you maintain mindful awareness of your internal experience—thoughts, emotions, body sensations, and images. The therapist provides supportive presence while your brain naturally processes the trauma. Unlike talk therapy, you don't need to verbalize or analyze—your brain does the healing work.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Dual Attunement</strong> Brainspotting uses simultaneous attunement to both the therapist's relational presence and your internal experience. This dual attunement creates a safe container for processing even the most difficult trauma.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Accessing the Subcortical Brain</strong> Brainspotting bypasses the thinking brain and accesses the deeper emotional and survival parts of your brain where trauma is stored. This is why brainspotting can resolve trauma that talk therapy can't reach.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Brainspotting vs. EMDR: What's the Difference?</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Both brainspotting and EMDR are powerful trauma therapies, but they work differently. EMDR uses bilateral stimulation and follows a structured protocol, making it excellent for single-incident trauma and PTSD. Brainspotting is more flexible and client-led, allowing your brain to process at its own pace. Brainspotting tends to access deeper, subcortical trauma and works well for complex trauma, dissociation, and cases where clients feel stuck. Some clients respond better to EMDR, others to brainspotting—our clinicians are trained in both modalities and will help determine which approach is best for you.</p>

<h3 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Heal Deep Trauma with Brainspotting</h3>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Brainspotting offers hope for healing even the deepest, most complex trauma. If you've tried other therapies without full resolution, if you struggle with dissociation, or if you carry trauma that feels too big to talk about, brainspotting can help. You deserve to access the healing your brain is capable of.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Contact Healing Speak today for specialized brainspotting therapy. Our trauma-informed approach provides the safety, support, and expertise you need to process deep-seated trauma and reclaim your life. Your healing is possible.</p>
