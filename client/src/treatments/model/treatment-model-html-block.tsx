<h4 className="font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">Evidence-based treatment for adjustment disorders with anxiety, depression, or behavioral symptoms</h4>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">Adjustment disorders develop when life stressors—job loss, divorce, health diagnosis, relocation, financial problems, or other significant changes—overwhelm your usual coping abilities. Unlike everyday stress, adjustment disorders cause marked distress disproportionate to the stressor and interfere with your daily functioning. You might experience anxiety, depression, behavioral changes, or difficulty concentrating that began shortly after a stressful event and feel more intense than what others might experience in similar situations. These aren't signs of weakness—they're indications that you need additional support to navigate a challenging period.</p>

<p className="whitespace-normal break-words">At Healing Speak, we provide compassionate, evidence-based adjustment disorder treatment that helps you develop coping strategies, process difficult emotions, and regain your equilibrium. According to the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-mental-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, adjustment disorders are common responses to stress, and therapy effectively supports recovery. Our adjustment disorder therapy combines cognitive behavioral techniques, problem-solving skills, and emotional processing to help you navigate transitions successfully. Many clients also benefit from our <a href="/conditions/life-transitions" className="text-blue-600 underline">life transitions therapy</a> for support during major life changes.</p>
