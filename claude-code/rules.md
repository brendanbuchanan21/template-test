# Rules for Claude Page Generation

## Structure Preservation
- Copy all HTML tags, divs, Tailwind classes, spacing, and font hierarchy exactly.
- Do not remove, add, or rearrange any structural elements.
- H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy must remain intact.
- Preserve all styling classes, wrappers, and layout from template.html.

## Content Replacement
- Replace text content only, based on the topic and brand context.
- Maintain proper HTML formatting (<p>, <ul>, <h1-h3>).

## SEO Instructions
- Generate 5 high-intent keywords naturally and what people would google regarding the page topic e.g. for the adhd page "adhd therapy" as a key word.
- Maintain ~2.0% keyword density across the content.
- Integrate keywords naturally in H1, H2, H3, and paragraphs.
