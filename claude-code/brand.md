Who We Serve
Healing Speak was founded to serve empaths, caregivers, and helpers—nurses, physicians, therapists, counselors, teachers, and students—who struggle with trauma, Personality Disorders, Dissociative Disorders, substance use, and narcissistic abuse. Our ideal clients have often tried traditional talk therapy and found it didn't work. They value natural and holistic approaches but want them grounded in evidence and science. They're looking for therapists who understand complex trauma and won't just let them talk without creating real, lasting change.
What Makes Us Different
Unlike big box therapy platforms that hire anyone with a license, Healing Speak specializes in treating cases that others find difficult. We offer EMDR, Brainspotting, Energy Psychology, Somatic Therapy, and other evidence-based techniques that go beyond traditional talk therapy. Our diverse and qualified providers bring unique perspectives and cultural sensitivity. We accept most major insurances, offer weekend and evening hours, and provide efficient, solution-focused treatment. We don't draw out therapy unnecessarily—if we can help, we help quickly. If we can't, we refer you to someone who can.


PRACTICE OVERVIEW
Founding Story
Healing Speak Counseling, LLC was founded in 2018 with a clear vision: to help those who don't think they can be helped. After 11 years working in substance abuse and community mental health, our founder recognized that many people were falling through the cracks of traditional therapy models. Traditional talk therapy, while valuable, wasn't reaching the root causes of trauma for many clients, particularly empaths and caregivers who had experienced narcissistic abuse or complex personality disorders.
A Personal Mission Born from Experience: The founder's belief is simple but profound: everyone is good at heart and deserves peace. Working with 'tough cases'—people whom other therapists found difficult or treatment-resistant—revealed that these individuals simply needed different approaches. They needed therapists who understood trauma deeply, who were trained in specialized techniques like EMDR, Somatic Therapy, and Brainspotting, and who could treat conditions like Complex PTSD, Dissociative Disorders, substance abuse, and Personality Disorders with expertise and compassion.
The practice was built from the ground up to be efficient, evidence-based, and holistic. Every decision reflects a commitment to not 'milk' clients but to create genuine, lasting change. Healing Speak exists because someone needs to specialize in the difficult cases, to help the helpers who are themselves struggling, and to bring peace to those who have tried everything else without success.
The Problems We Solve
Traditional mental health care fails many people through:
Big box therapy platforms that hire anyone with a license, regardless of specialization
Traditional talk therapy that doesn't address root trauma or create lasting change
Therapists who let clients talk without resolution—trauma remains unresolved
Lack of specialists who understand Personality Disorders and narcissistic abuse
Therapists who use outdated 'old school' approaches that aren't efficient
Providers who draw out treatment unnecessarily instead of getting results quickly
Limited access to weekend and evening appointments
Dismissal of symptoms that aren't immediately understood

Our Solution
Healing Speak eliminates these barriers through:
Telehealth Convenience: Therapy accessible from anywhere in Florida
Specialized Expertise: Certified in treating trauma, Personality Disorders, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
Evidence-Based Techniques: EMDR, Brainspotting, Emotional Freedom Technique, Trauma-Focused CBT, DBT, Somatic Therapy 
Efficient & Solution-Focused: Jump into treatment, get results quickly, don't draw it out
Insurance Accessibility: In-network with 10+ major insurance providers
Flexible Scheduling: Weekend and evening hours available

Brainspotting
Advanced brain-based therapy that accesses and processes trauma stored in the subcortical brain. Highly effective for deep-seated trauma, dissociation, and complex PTSD.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
Evidence-based approach focusing on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to emotional distress. Foundation for treating anxiety, depression, and many other conditions.
Trauma-Focused CBT
Specialized CBT designed specifically for trauma survivors. Combines trauma-sensitive interventions with cognitive behavioral techniques to address PTSD symptoms and process traumatic experiences.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
Skills-based approach for emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness. Particularly effective for Personality Disorders, especially Borderline Personality Disorder. Our provider is a Certified DBT provider.
Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)
Promotes psychological flexibility through acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based living. Helps clients move forward even while dealing with difficult emotions.
Solution-Focused Brief Therapy
Goal-oriented approach focusing on solutions and strengths rather than problems. Aligns with our efficient, results-focused philosophy.
Motivational Interviewing
Client-centered approach that enhances motivation for change. Particularly useful for substance use treatment and ambivalence about therapy.
Play Therapy & Behavioral Parent Training
Age-appropriate interventions for children dealing with behavioral challenges, trauma, and emotional regulation difficulties. Parent training helps caregivers support their children's progress.
Treatment Philosophy
Our treatment philosophy combines evidence-based medicine with proven integrative approaches. We are patient-centered—making decisions together with clients, never imposing our agenda. We believe in whole-person care that addresses mind, body, and spirit. Our approach is efficient and solution-focused: if we can help, we jump into treatment and get results as quickly as possible. If we can't help, we honestly refer you to someone who can. We never 'milk' clients or draw out treatment unnecessarily. Everyone deserves peace, and we're here to help you find it again.
What We Don't Offer
Healing Speak does not prescribe medication. We are a psychotherapy practice specializing in evidence-based talk therapy and trauma treatment interventions. If medication management is needed, we can coordinate with your prescriber or help you find one.
